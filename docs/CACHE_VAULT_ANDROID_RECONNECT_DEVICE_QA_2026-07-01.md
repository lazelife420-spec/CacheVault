## Run Sheet

### 1. Fresh Launch

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Launch the freshly installed app on the phone.
  - Observe first visible state before any pairing.
- Expected result:
  - App opens cleanly.
  - No false connected state.
  - No trusted PC state if none exists.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - N/A unless desktop shows unexpected state.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - This step is visual and must be verified on-device.

### 2. Pairing

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Pair phone to desktop.
  - Confirm pairing completes on both devices.
  - Check the phone connection/settings screen for remembered PC metadata.
  - Check desktop paired-device UI for the trusted phone entry.
- Expected result:
  - Trusted PC metadata is saved on phone.
  - Desktop trusted phone record is saved.
  - Phone shows PC name, IP, and last seen.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - Confirm this uses the new reconnect lifecycle flow, not a stale prior pairing.

### 3. Close/Reopen Reconnect Prompt

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Close the app normally.
  - Reopen the app.
  - Wait for rediscovery of the remembered PC.
  - Verify the `Connect to this PC?` prompt appears.
  - Tap `Connect`.
  - Observe desktop state change.
- Expected result:
  - Approval prompt appears after reopen.
  - Tap `Connect` re-establishes connection without retyping token.
  - Desktop moves to online/connected.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - Record how long rediscovery took on this Wi-Fi.

### 4. Not Now Path

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Reopen the app again after prior pairing.
  - When the approval prompt appears, tap `Not now`.
  - Observe both phone and desktop state.
- Expected result:
  - Desktop does not falsely show online.
  - Phone remains paired but offline or waiting.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - This is a truthfulness check for paired-vs-live state separation.

### 5. Auto-Connect Consent

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Explicitly enable auto-connect consent on the phone.
  - Close and reopen the app.
  - Observe whether reconnect occurs without retyping token.
  - Confirm status text remains understandable.
- Expected result:
  - Auto-connect is only enabled after explicit consent.
  - Reconnect occurs without manual token entry.
  - Status remains clear and honest.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Optional if helpful.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - If the app reconnects before consent, mark as `FAIL`.

### 6. Keep Connected Foreground Service

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Enable `Keep Connected`.
  - Confirm Android foreground notification appears.
  - Background the app.
  - Observe whether connection survives better than normal backgrounding.
  - Stop the service from notification or app.
  - Observe resulting status.
- Expected result:
  - Foreground notification appears.
  - Background behavior is improved relative to normal mode.
  - Stop action works.
  - Status updates honestly after stop.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Optional if state transition is visible.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - Do not interpret “better” as “guaranteed.”

### 7. Killed-App Limitation

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Force stop or swipe away the app if applicable on this device.
  - Observe whether UI/desktop makes any false wake claim.
  - Reopen the app.
  - Verify reconnect flow resumes.
- Expected result:
  - No fake claim that the PC can wake a killed app.
  - Reopen resumes reconnect flow honestly.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Optional if useful.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - This is a critical product honesty check.

### 8. Revoke

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - On desktop, use `Revoke All Devices`.
  - Attempt reconnect from phone using old token.
  - Observe phone state.
  - Re-pair using a fresh token.
  - Confirm fresh re-pair succeeds.
- Expected result:
  - Old token is rejected.
  - Phone shows revoked / needs re-pair state.
  - Fresh re-pair works.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Pending only if failure occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - If revoked token still works, mark as critical `FAIL`.

### 9. Desktop Labels

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Exercise the phone flow needed to show each desktop state.
  - Capture desktop UI in:
    - waiting for approval
    - online
    - offline
    - revoked
    - last seen
- Expected result:
  - Desktop clearly distinguishes all target states.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - N/A unless paired state on phone helps explain.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Pending.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Usually N/A.
- Notes / caveats:
  - This is a desktop-truthfulness verification tied to the Android lane.

### 10. Regression

- Status: `PENDING`
- Exact steps performed:
  - Verify send-to-PC/mobile inbox still works.
  - Watch for Android crash during lifecycle testing.
  - Watch for desktop crash during pairing, reconnect, revoke, and inbox flow.
- Expected result:
  - Send-to-PC/mobile inbox still works.
  - No Android crash.
  - No desktop crash.
- Actual result:
  - Pending manual execution.
- Android screenshot filename/path:
  - Optional.
- Desktop screenshot filename/path:
  - Optional.
- Logcat filename/path if relevant:
  - Required if any failure or crash occurs.
- Notes / caveats:
  - Treat crashes as blocking failures even if reconnect otherwise works.

## Post-Run Verdict

- Final verdict: `HOLD`
- Promote to `PASS` only if all critical reconnect, revoke, truthfulness, and regression flows pass on-device.
- Keep as `HOLD` if any blocker remains or any critical step is still untested.

## Commit Guidance After QA

- Commit only the QA doc updates and evidence-path references if appropriate.
- Do not publish anything from this lane.
